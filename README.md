FROM spending_details
WHERE YEAR(transaction_date) IN (2023, 2024)
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_expenditure DESC;
```
**Purpose:** Identify the spending categories contributing the most during the selected years.

---

### 2. High-Value Items with Low Purchase Frequency

GROUP BY item
ORDER BY revenue DESC, purchase_frequency ASC
LIMIT 10;
```
